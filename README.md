# World-GDP-Data

## Objective: 
GDP is an important measurement for economists and investors because it tracks changes in the size of the entire economy. In addition to serving as a comprehensive measure of economic health, GDP reports provide insights about the factors driving economic growth or holding it back.  I have used Web scraping to fetch data from IMF’s website (for GDP data) and Worldometer’s website for population data to find relationship between data sets.

## Methods:

Initially, exploratory data analysis was performed to understand the data better and compute some major descriptive statistics. I produced some illustrative visualizations representing the dataset as well. Following are some of the techniques used to achive the goal of this project. 
 - Web Scraping
 - SQL
 - Scatterplot
 - Histogram
 - Pie Chart
